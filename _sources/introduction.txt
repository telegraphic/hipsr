Introduction
============

HIPSR is a new reconfigurable digital backend for the Parkes multibeam receiver.

Architecture
------------

HIPSR consists of digitizer cards; FPGA digital processing boards for "low-level" DSP; 
a 10GbE switch for data interconnect; and, a CPU/GPU cluster for "high-level" DSP and data storage. The network architecture is shown in the figure below:
